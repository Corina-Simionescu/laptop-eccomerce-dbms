# DMBS for Laptop E-Commerce Platform

This project combines two college projects: SQL and PL/SQL development for an e-commerce platform specializing in laptop sales.

## SQL part

In the SQL part of the project, I designed and implemented the database schema for an e-commerce platform focused on laptop sales. This involved creating tables, defining relationships, and optimizing data storage using SQL functionalities such as joins, views, and indexes.

## PL/SQL part

In the PL/SQL part I extended the functionality of the e-commerce platform. I developed PL/SQL packages, procedures, functions, and triggers to automate tasks and improve overall system performance. Exception handling mechanisms were implemented to ensure robust error management.

## Setup Instructions

1. Run `create_tables.sql` to create the database tables.
2. Run `insert_data.sql` to populate the tables with initial data.
3. Open `sql_operations.sql` and execute the individual SQL blocks as needed to perform various SQL operations.
4. Open `plsql_operations.sql` and execute the individual PL/SQL blocks as needed to perform various PL/SQL operations.
